My ultimate comfort food:

DIRECTIONS

To Marinade: Place cubed chicken in a nonporous bowl with yogurt, lemon juice, chili powder,salt and liquid smoke. Refrigerate for 1 hour.
Mix in garlic, garam masala, butter, chili powder, ginger paste, lemon juice and oil. Replace cover and refrigerate to marinate for another 3 to 4 hours.
Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
Place chicken on an oven sheet and bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes.
To Make Sauce: Melt butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in 1 tbsp garam masala. When masala begins to puff and bubble, mix in ginger, garlic paste and green chile peppers. Saute 5 minutes, then stir in tomato puree, tomato paste, chili powder, salt, 1/2 tbsp garam masala and a couple more drops of liquid smoke. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring in honey, fenugreek and cream.
Place chicken and pan drippings in sauce mixture. Simmer on medium-low heat for about an hour or until liquid is reduced by 1/3.
Salt to taste and garnish with fresh chopped cilantro (optional).
Enjoy!
